<p>This month is my one year derby anniversary. I’ve been skating in one way or another (skateboarding and rollerblading) for a good part of my life, but when I went to college I stopped. So before last year I hadn’t skated in a good bit. I also didn’t know men could play roller derby nor did I know much about it.</p>
<p>Last November I met my girlfriend Staci aka Dimpled Devastation who introduced me to the sport by inviting me to come and watch her teams practice. I was floored, and I thought, I want to play this! That old spark for skating came rushing back. So on the way home I had said, I wish guys could play roller derby, it looks like a lot of fun, and of course Staci laughed and let me know that everyone can play roller derby. I didn’t know any better. Then she said, you should give it a try.</p>
<p>So January 4th, 2019 Staci, our friend Tiffany, and I all made a trip to North Carolina to buy my first pair of skates and pads.</p>

<p>It was a gamble, because I bought a full kit before even stepping on the rink. But, I knew I was going to love it.</p>

<p>However, it turns out I wasn’t the greatest at it right off the bat. After getting my kit, I joined the Augusta Soul City Sirens’ fresh-meat boot camp to learn how to play.</p>

<p>Just look at the dorkiness! I was having fun though. The picture on the right is my fresh-meat class. We had a blast!</p>
<p>Checkout these videos from my first few weeks learning how to skate and play derby:</p>

<p>As you can see I had, and still have, a lot of work to do, but I got to work! I started eating right, I was already vegan, but I changed it up and started eating a whole plant-based diet. Furthermore, I started working out off skates. I’m happy to report that over the last year I’ve lost 110 lbs and have gotten a lot stronger and a lot faster.</p>
<p>On top of that, to get stronger at skating I started skating three times a week for 1 to 2 hours. Before the pandemic I went to practice with the Sirens three times a week, but during the pandemic I had to train alone, and I managed to keep it up! I started learning a lot of new drills to get better at footwork. Checkout these videos of my progress six months into my training:</p>

<p>Fast forward a year to the day, and Staci and I went back to North Carolina to get my second pair of skates:</p>

<p>My original skates were low end, because I wasn’t sure if I would stick with it. I put them through the ringer. Check out these pics:</p>

<p>I mean, I put groves in the boots from working on my edges. The plates also twist and bend a lot.</p>
<p>After getting my new skates I’ve improved a lot; it’s surprising how a good set of plates changes things. Here are some of my latest videos from my Instagram profile:</p>

<p>I’m progressing, and roller derby has had a positive impact on my health, my mental health, and my social life. One day I hope to be a decent jammer. I’m now a new member of the <a href="https://carolinawreckingballs.com/" target="_blank">North Carolina Wrecking Balls’</a> league. I’m excited for my derby future.</p>
