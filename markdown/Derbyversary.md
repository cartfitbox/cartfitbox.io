This month is my one year derby anniversary.  I've been skating in one
way or another (skateboarding and rollerblading) for a good part of my
life, but when I went to college I stopped.  So before last year I
hadn't skated in a good bit.  I also didn't know men could play roller
derby nor did I know much about it. 

Last November I met my girlfriend Staci aka Dimpled Devastation who
introduced me to the sport by inviting me to come and watch her teams
practice.  I was floored, and I thought, I want to play this!  That
old spark for skating came rushing back.  So on the way home I had
said, I wish guys could play roller derby, it looks like a lot of fun,
and of course Staci laughed and let me know that everyone can play
roller derby.  I didn't know any better.  Then she said, you should
give it a try.

So January 4th, 2019 Staci, our friend Tiffany, and I all made a trip
to North Carolina to buy my first pair of skates and pads.

It was a gamble, because I bought a full kit before even stepping on
the rink.  But, I knew I was going to love it.

However, it turns out I wasn't the greatest at it right off the bat.
After getting my kit, I joined the Augusta Soul City Sirens'
fresh-meat boot camp to learn how to play.

Just look at the dorkiness!  I was having fun though.  The picture on the right is my fresh-meat class.  We had a blast!  

Checkout these videos from my first few weeks learning how to skate
and play derby:

As you can see I had, and still have, a lot of work to do, but I got
to work!  I started eating right, I was already vegan, but I changed
it up and started eating a whole plant-based diet.  Furthermore, I
started working out off skates.  I'm happy to report that over the last
year
I've lost 110 lbs and have gotten a lot stronger and a lot faster.  

On top of that, to get stronger at skating I started skating three
times a week for 1 to 2 hours.  Before the pandemic I went to practice
with the Sirens three times a week, but during the pandemic I had to
train alone, and I managed to keep it up! I started learning a lot of
new drills to get better at footwork.  Checkout these videos of my
progress six months into my training:

Fast forward a year to the day, and Staci and I went back to North
Carolina to get my second pair of skates:

My original skates were low end, because I wasn't sure if I would
stick with it.  I put them through the ringer.  Check out these pics:

I mean, I put groves in the boots from working on my edges.  The
plates also twist and bend a lot.

After getting my new skates I've improved a lot; it's surprising how a
good set of plates changes things.  Here are some of my latest videos
from my Instagram profile:

I'm progressing, and roller derby has had a positive impact on my
health, my mental health, and my social life.  One day I hope to be a
decent jammer.  I'm now a new member of the [North Carolina Wrecking
Balls'](https://carolinawreckingballs.com/){ target="_blank" } league.
I'm excited for my derby future.
