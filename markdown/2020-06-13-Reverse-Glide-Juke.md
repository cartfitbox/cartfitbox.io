There is this really fun and neat juke I've been working on over the last few weeks.  I'm calling it the Reverse Glide Juke, but I'm not sold on this name.  One really cool aspect of this move is that it composes several of the minimal skills we learn when we first begin playing roller derby.  It's a combination of:

1. Transitions
2. One-footed glides
3. Change of directions
4. Engagement of the inner edge
5. Lateral movements

The main idea is that we have some blockers we want to get around, but we want to exploit a rapid lane change to confuse them.  So suppose we are approaching two blockers from the outside:

As I said above, our goal is to quickly change from an outside approach to an inside approach, but this move does something more.  We will change from a shoulder-leading to a hip-leading approach by transitioning and curving around to the inside edge:

To make the move quick, we will transition onto our outer leg -- here that would be the right leg -- and engage our inside edge to curve around the blockers into the inside lane.  Now since we transition, we change into a hip-leading approach so even if someone gets us, it is more likely that we can at least get our hips beyond our two blockers.  If the blockers also have weak lateral movements, this will exploit that to our favor.

This move looks like this:

As one can see the wind was not cooperating with me.  In this post, I'm going to break this move down so that anyone can learn it.  If you are already practicing these moves, and would like to just see the videos, then you can find the complete video playlist here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPSM18spFjNqqBfJ4T04aHZMrzHJV5FOb" target="_blank">The Reverse Glide Juke Playlist</a>

Practice the following steps to learn this move:

1. **(Minimal Skill) One footed glide.**  To practice this, skate forward naturally, and then lift one leg off the ground and balance while in motion.  To get a feel for this, first try it out standing still, and then move to skating.  Practice this on both feet.  Here are some of my glides:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVsGGuqEECg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

2. **(Minimal Skill) Transitions.**  This move is done by skating forward, and picking one foot up while twisting around to skate backwards.  Here are some examples:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JO8JT7LSyXg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

   There are two types of transitions.  What I would call a **frontside transition** -- or left-shoulder transition -- where you transition by moving with your left shoulder in front, and your right shoulder in back moving clockwise.  Compare this with a **backside transition** -- or right-shoulder transition -- where you transition by moving your right shoulder in front, and your left shoulder in back moving counterclockwise.

   The backside transition is the one we will be using in this move, but practice both.

3. **Backside transitions with a glide.**  This step combines steps 1 and 2.  In this move, you transition into a one-footed glide.  Here is an example of mine:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UH-nWguB_2A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

   While doing this move, start by doing a standard transition, but then when you are nearly fully around push off onto your opposite foot, and then glide.

4. **Inside edge activation.**  To add the curve while gliding you have to learn how to activate your inside edge.  This is where you apply pressure on the side of your foot that results in your skate leaning inward.  For example:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIuePS6pCqQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

   Learning to activate this edge can help with a lot of skating technique; e.g., cutting, plow stops, and hockey stops.  Tip: If you are finding that your skate isn't moving much when applying pressure, then your trucks might be too tight.  Loosen them just a little bit (always in small amounts), and see how it feels.

5. **C-Cuts.**  Getting used to using your inside edge can take some practice, but doing C-cuts can really help get the feel for it.  First, try them out standing still, here is how:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIpfB2VdTtU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

   One tip is to notice the sound my skate makes, the heel screeches, because it's sliding.  This is necessary to get the sharpness of the C-cut.  Once you are comfortable with standstill C-cuts, put them in motion going backward:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxzKtLCgdhY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

   These are difficult, especially if you are on soft wheels or sticky flooring, so be easy on yourself.  They can be hard.  I've fallen tons of times practicing these, but they will make you a stronger skater who's more agile.

6. **The Juke.** Now is the time to put together what you've learned into the juke itself.  Start small, but the goal is to try and get quick at transitioning onto a one-footed glide, and then cutting around objects using the inside edge.  But, first, start out just practicing getting the transition, glide, and curve.  Here is me working on this:

   <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVshAtsHdsA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

   Sometimes I try and make the curve wide, other times I work on getting the curve nice and sharp.  I also work on trying to ride the glide in a complete 360.  Playing around will make you more comfortable with the move later.  Once you feel good with it, start practicing around an object or a friend.

7. Remember to have fun! That's what this is all about.
